	A penetration test is considered a snapshot in time.  The findings and recommendations reflect the information gathered during the assessment and not any changes or modifications made outside of that period.\\
	Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security controls. \pentesterShort\ prioritized the assessment to identify the weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. \pentesterShort\  recommends conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.

	\boxsection{Assessment Overview}
	

	From December 2nd, 2022 to December 9th, 2022, \pentesterShort\ engaged \companyNameShort\ to evaluate the security posture of its infrastructure compared to current industry best practices that included a penetration test.  All testing performed is based on the NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, OWASP Testing Guide (v4), and customized testing frameworks. 
Phases of penetration testing activities include the following:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Planning – Customer goals are gathered and rules of engagement obtained.
	\item  Discovery – Perform scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak areas, and exploits.
	\item Attack – Confirm potential vulnerabilities through exploitation and perform additional discovery upon new access.
	\item Reporting – Document all found vulnerabilities and exploits, failed attempts, and company strengths and weaknesses.
	\end{itemize}

	\boxsection{Assessment Components}
	
	\label{sec:assessment_components}
	A penetration test emulates the role of an attacker attempting to gain access to an internal network without internal resources or inside knowledge. \pentester attempts to gather sensitive information through open-source intelligence (OSINT), including employee information, historical breached passwords, and more that can be leveraged against external systems to gain internal network access. \pentester also performs scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities in hopes of exploitation.

		\cellcolor{Low}\textcolor{white}{\textbf{Low}} & 0.1-3.9 & Vulnerabilities are non-exploitable but would reduce an organization’s attack surface.  It is advised to form a plan of action and patch during the next maintenance window.  \\ \hline \cellcolor{Info}\textcolor{white}{\textbf{Informational}} & N/A & No vulnerability exists.  Additional information is provided regarding items noticed during testing, strong controls, and additional documentation.  \\ \hline

	PENTESTER evaluated \companyName' external security posture through an external network penetration test from December 2nd to December 9th, 2022. The test consisted of a series of attacks designed to uncover vulnerabilities in \companyName' systems. Unfortunately, \pentester found several critical vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain full access to \companyName' internal network and control of the DMZ. It is highly recommended that \companyName address these vulnerabilities as soon as possible, as they are easily discovered and exploited with minimal effort. Failure to address these vulnerabilities could result in a significant security breach for \companyName.
